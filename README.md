<h1>wisconsin-breast-cancer-prediction</h1>

<p>This notebook contains basic EDA and data modelling using <b>LogisticRegression</b> and <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> along with hyperparameter tuning.</p>

<p>The repository is a learning exercise to apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It covers simple EDA of the breast cancer dataset. The dataset used is taken from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data">Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set</a>.</li>
  <li>The modelling is done using three machine learning models to obtain the baseline metrics.</li>
  <li>The DecisionTreeClassifier model is then dropped, as the other two models perform well.</li>
  <li>Hyperparameter tuning, done on LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier models to further improve the accuracy score and other metrics.</li>
</ul>
